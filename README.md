 The goal of the gadget is to give real-time skin parameter monitoring, including elasticity, temperature,
 and hydration. The Raspberry Pi, which processes the data and offers actionable insights through an
 intuitive interface, receives several sensor integration's from the system. The findings show how
 inexpensive hardware and cutting-edge sensor technologies can be used to provide a useful tool for
 managing skin health. This study advances the field of wearable health technology by examining the
 system's efficacy, drawbacks, and potential enhancements.
